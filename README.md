# Challenge Rating Calculator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (2024)

This app takes in the quantity and level of the player characters, and quantity and challenge rating of the monsters, and calculates how much XP budget is available and how much has been spent, determining if the encounter is a Low, Moderate, High, or beyond High difficulty, according to the 2024 Dungeon Master's Guide encounter building rules.

To assist dungeon masters, the XP budget and XP spent are plotted on a graph-like graphic showing visually how much XP has been spent vs unspent and how close to the next encounter category a given encounter is.

To avoid needing an inevitably incomplete database of monsters, the challenge rating of the monsters is input directly rather than the monsters themselves. As a monster in a lair would actually have a higher XP value than its base challenge rating it needs to be input into the calculator at that higher challenge rating to match the XP it would be worth instead of the challenge rating listed on its stat block for when outside its lair.
